## Simulation controller
This is the library that controls the simulation.


### How to use

- In the center there is the main page where the topology can be seen, click on a node to perform actions on it, use arrows or wasd to move the topology around and use trackpad/ mousewheel to zoom in and out.

- One the rigth side window you can add a new node (Note that to add a new node you'll have to specify a PDR and two neighbors), you can always add or remove connections by clicking on that specific node.
In the bottom parts you can see infos about the selected node, and you can also remove it.

- On the top left there are settings to enable/ disable music, toogle the unchecked mode wich let you have any topology as long as the graph remains connected, and reset the global info of the SC.
